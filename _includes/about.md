### Professional

Curious what I've been up to during [work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-papitto/) hours? [Here]({{ site.url }}/download/AnnaPapittoResume.pdf) is a PDF of my resume (as of February 2020).

I've been reading [technical books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/107974217-anna-papitto?shelf=technical) recently; please recommend more to me!

### Personal

I've been surrounded by art since I was born, thanks to my mom ([insta](https://www.instagram.com/amei_art_gallery/)) and my dad ([site](https://www.brucepapitto.com/); [insta](https://www.instagram.com/brucepapittostudio/)). I've started pursuing this family knowledge myself - see some pictures of my [oil paintings]({{ site.url }}/oil), [watercolors]({{ site.url }}/watercolor), and [drawings]({{ site.url }}/drawing).

I'm obsessed with a dance called [Lindy Hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop). Observe my progression through my practice and audition [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLleMhVsxATAS5iZEDKibwG61kd76IkB3M).
