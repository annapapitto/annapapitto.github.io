<h2>Artistic Statement</h2>

<p>
I've been surrounded by art since I was born, thanks to my
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/amei.art.gallery/"> mother</a> and my
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/brucepapittosculptor/">father</a>.
I've started pursuing this family knowledge myself â€” see some pictures of my
<a href="/oil">oil paintings</a>, <a href="/watercolor">watercolors</a>,
<a href="/drawing">drawings</a>, and <a href="/sculpture">sculptures</a>.

I'm obsessed with a dance called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop">Lindy Hop</a>.
