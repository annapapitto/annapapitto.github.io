<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>
I've been surrounded by art since I was born, thanks to my mother
(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/amei.art.gallery/">insta</a>) and my father
(<a href="https://www.brucepapitto.com/">site</a>;
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/brucepapittosculptor/">insta</a>).
I've started pursuing this family knowledge myself - see some pictures of my
<a href="/oil">oil paintings</a>, <a href="/watercolor">watercolors</a>,
<a href="/drawing">drawings</a>, and <a href="/sculpture">sculptures</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm obsessed with a dance called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop">Lindy Hop</a>.
Observe my progression through my practice and audition <a href=
