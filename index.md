<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>
  I've been surrounded by art since I was born, thanks to my mom <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amei_art_gallery/">insta</a>) and my dad (<a href="https://www.brucepapitto.com/">site</a>; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brucepapittostudio/">insta</a>). I've started pursuing this family knowledge myself - see some pictures of my <a href="/oil">oil paintings</a>, <a href="/watercolor">watercolors</a>, and <a href="/drawing">drawings</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm obsessed with a dance called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop">Lindy Hop</a>. Observe my progression through my practice and audition <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLleMhVsxATAS5iZEDKibwG61kd76IkB3M">videos</a>.
